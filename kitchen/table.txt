It's a rectangular, wooden table with a smooth finish. Unlike the other table,
this one is held up by four legs. It is very clean.

It's next to the window, and surrounded by 4 chairs. In one of the chairs sits
a robot. It looks like a human but its metalic body is coated in a red rust.
Its arms are on the table, one wrist on the other. In one of its hands, it
holds a feather duster, which is slowly sweeps back and forth across the table.

It is fixated on the rain outside the window, and doesn't seem to notice you.
