It's a piece of paper on the table with a printed message. It says:

"Hey, if you want to walk around, you can use the `cd' command, followed by
the name of the location you want to go to. Listings in blue are valid
locations."

On the back, there is a hastily scribbled message:

"Oh yeah, try the `inventory' command first."
