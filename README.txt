Yep, just like that!

Unfortunately, I can't make a text file colorful, so bear with me.

Next, I'll teach you how to look around. In a Linux command line, you can use
the "ls" command. You can do this:

	ls

This will tell you about the files in your current location.

Keep in mind that you can use "more" to read any file, not just this one. If
you find other files you'd like to read, you can type "more" followed by the
file's name.
